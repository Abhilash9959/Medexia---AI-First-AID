# Aidify RAG Integration 

This document describes the integration of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) image analysis system into the Aidify application.

## Overview

The integration enhances the injury analysis capabilities of the Aidify application by replacing the previous mock-based or less accurate image analysis with a more accurate Gemini-based analysis system that uses RAG to provide more contextually relevant first aid instructions.

## Key Components

1. **Google Generative AI Integration**
   - Added Gemini model for accurate image analysis
   - Implemented multi-modal analysis (image + text)

2. **RAG System**
   - Knowledge Base: First aid information for different injury types
   - Vector Embeddings: Simple vector representation of knowledge
   - Retrieval: Matching query with relevant knowledge
   - Context Enhancement: Augmenting prompts with retrieved knowledge

3. **Enhanced UI**
   - Added RAG info display to show knowledge sources used
   - Improved analysis process feedback
   - Better first aid instructions generation

## Files Added/Modified

1. **New Files:**
   - `src/lib/knowledge-base.ts` - First aid knowledge base
   - `src/lib/rag-utils.ts` - RAG implementation utilities
   - `src/lib/gemini-api.ts` - Gemini API integration
   - `.env` - Environment variables for API keys

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `src/services/injuryAnalysisService.ts` - Updated to use Gemini with RAG
   - `src/pages/AppPage.tsx` - Updated UI to support RAG features

## Setup

1. Install the Google Generative AI package:
   ```
   npm install @google/generative-ai
   ```

2. Get a Google Gemini API key from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

3. Add your API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## How It Works

1. User uploads an injury image
2. The image is sent to the Gemini API along with a prompt
3. RAG system retrieves relevant first aid information
4. Retrieved information enhances the prompt
5. Gemini generates detailed first aid instructions
6. Response is parsed into structured format
7. UI displays the instructions and RAG sources

## Benefits

- More accurate injury analysis through advanced AI models
- Better first aid instructions through knowledge retrieval
- Transparency in showing knowledge sources
- Improved user confidence in results
- Fallback mechanism to existing system if Gemini analysis fails

## Note

This integration maintains the beautiful UI/UX from Aidify while replacing the backend image analysis with the more accurate implementation from the test-main project.
